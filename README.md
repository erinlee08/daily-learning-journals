well,besides from learning what we went over in class, i learned the importance of committing often. I have been saving my work but haven't developed a habit of committing to gh. I now have learned the benefit of that. finally, with the help I was getting during the lab, i was finally getting my pictures to show up ( may not work how i wanted them to, but least, 3 pictures showed up and new ones were generated at random.) After class, I don't know what I did, my code was messed up again. i spent hours trying to get it back to how it was before, but no such luck.... Had I committed, i would have been able to pull from gh...

learned about canvas today. seems like a really cool feature to have on any website. would have liked to be able to use that for my assignment.

today, i reviewed the git acp to both master and branch. Now I know why sometimes my pushes never showed up in gh ( wrong repo).
also, with today's assignment, I felt that I knew what to do, but it was just putting the right code was hard (like how it has been with all assignments.) I am not sure how conducive this is for me in terms of learning to code....

today was a better day for me. what i did differently was that i was more focused on teaching myself what the lecture/demo meant in my own words. Also, i will start commenting when writing code as well to really check my own understanding and reinforce the concept. Hope that will work. Repetition, reptition.

learned about the constructor today. made sense why it's an important concept in JS for performance and readability issues. My frustration for the day was more with my laptop. I am not sure if it's my computer or the websites I was trying to use. Google, codepen were giving me problems. Craig was there when this whole thing happened. I had a working code ( validated by Craig) that couldn't run on google nor codepen. when craig ran the same code on repl, it worked. I had thought maybe my laptop needed a break (just like me), but those two sites were still the same. And codepen was the only one I know of that allows the testing of the DOM. Well, no luck either!. I even copied and pasted your demo codes from today and still, no got ran.

feeling the same like yesterday if not more. I am glad we had the talk, Brian. I feel that I have been used to the college setting where students have more time to digest information, so I am trying to get used to this bootcamp setting. Like I said, I don't want to feel like im trying to play catch up all the time but doesn't mean i will or want to give up. I just have to gauge how it goes til the end of the week. I need to know when to say stop or switch gear or something.
I noticed something today when i was working on the last assigement. I was confused about the sumAndMultiply question and realized that using the google dev tool may help me. will definitely do that more often from now on.

Overwhelmed!
was reading the DOM in book and felt so very confused. For some reason, frequently i found the book not useful in terms of explaining concepts. For example, the book was talking about the tree, which confused the heck out of me. It made a bit sense later on when it had some diagrams that accompanied the texts. After I read the articles and googled online what DOM was, it made a bit sense to me now.

Today I learned about the loops. I find the "for" loops is easier to use. I realized when I was working on the assigement that I wasn't as familiar with the "while" loop as I thought.

working in pair programming is a good practice. Got really frustrated with the While loop.
