feeling the same like yesterday if not more. I am glad we had the talk, Brian. I feel that I have been used to the college setting where students have more time to digest information, so I am trying to get used to this bootcamp setting. Like I said, I don't want to feel like im trying to play catch up all the time but doesn't mean i will or want to give up. I just have to gauge how it goes til the end of the week. I need to know when to say stop or switch gear or something.
I noticed something today when i was working on the last assigement. I was confused about the sumAndMultiply question and realized that using the google dev tool may help me. will definitely do that more often from now on.

Overwhelmed!
was reading the DOM in book and felt so very confused. For some reason, frequently i found the book not useful in terms of explaining concepts. For example, the book was talking about the tree, which confused the heck out of me. It made a bit sense later on when it had some diagrams that accompanied the texts. After I read the articles and googled online what DOM was, it made a bit sense to me now.

Today I learned about the loops. I find the "for" loops is easier to use. I realized when I was working on the assigement that I wasn't as familiar with the "while" loop as I thought.

working in pair programming is a good practice. Got really frustrated with the While loop.
