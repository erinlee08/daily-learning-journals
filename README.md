Overwhelmed!
was reading the DOM in book and felt so very confused. For some reason, frequently i found the book not useful in terms of explaining concepts. For example, the book was talking about the tree, which confused the heck out of me. It made a bit sense later on when it had some diagrams that accompanied the texts. After I read the articles and googled online what DOM was, it made a bit sense to me now.

Today I learned about the loops. I find the "for" loops is easier to use. I realized when I was working on the assigement that I wasn't as familiar with the "while" loop as I thought.

working in pair programming is a good practice. Got really frustrated with the While loop.
